# Keeper Plugin for NVIDIA G-Assist

Transform your Windows development workflow with intelligent context management! This plugin lets you keep and restore your complete development environment through the G-Assist platform. Whether you're switching between projects or resuming work sessions, maintaining your perfect development setup has never been easier.


## What Can It Do?
- **Complete Environment Capture**: Keep your entire Windows development context including:
  - IDE projects and open files (VSCode, Cursor, JetBrains Suite)
  - Terminal sessions with working directories and environment variables
  - Browser tabs with full organization and grouping
  - Document states (Office, Notion, Obsidian, OneNote)
  - Communication tools (Slack, Discord, Teams, WeChat)
  - System settings (volume, clipboard, window positions)

- **Intelligent Restoration**: Restore your exact development environment with:
  - Precise window positioning and sizing
  - Virtual desktop assignments
  - Environment variable restoration
  - Application state recovery
  - Browser tab groups and organization

- **Voice-Activated Control**: Use natural language commands like:
  - "Save context as pytorch-research"
  - "Restore my machine learning project"
  - "Quick save current setup"

## Before You Start
Make sure you have:
- Windows 10/11 PC
- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- NVIDIA G-Assist installed
- Visual Studio 2022 (for building)
- Administrator privileges (for some system-level operations)

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Get the Files
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Keeper/src
```
This downloads all the necessary files to your computer.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This installs all required Python packages including:
- `pywin32` for Windows API access
- `psutil` for process management
- `pywinauto` for UI automation
- `requests` for browser debugging protocol
- `Pillow` for favicon processing

### Step 3: Build the Plugin
```bash
python build.py
```
This creates the executable and prepares all necessary files.

### Step 4: Install the Plugin
1. Navigate to the `dist` folder created by the build script
2. Copy the `contextkeeper` folder to:
```bash
%PROGRAMDATA%\NVIDIA Corporation\nvtopps\rise\plugins
```

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Make sure all files are copied, including:
- The executable (`g-assist-plugin-keeper.exe`)
- `manifest.json`
- Configuration files

## How to Use

### Basic Commands
Once everything is set up, you can manage your development contexts through simple voice commands:

**Saving Contexts:**
- "Save workspace as [project-name]"
- "Keep context as [project-name]"
- "Memorize realm as [project-name]" (alternative syntax)
- "Quick save" (auto-timestamped)

**Restoring Contexts:**
- "Restore [project-name]"
- "Switch to [project-name]"
- "Quick switch" (to most recent)

**Management Commands:**
- "List contexts" or "Show workspaces"
- "Close windows" (save & close all applications)
- "Minimize all" (save & minimize all windows)
- "Clear history [project-name]" (delete saved context files)
- "Clear all history" (delete all saved context files)

### Example Usage

**Saving a Machine Learning Project:**
```
You: "Save workspace as pytorch-research"
G-Assist: "pytorch-research context KEPT!
Windows: 8
Browser tabs: 42
IDE files: 15
Terminal sessions: 5
Environment variables: 23"
```

**Restoring a Web Development Environment:**
```
You: "Restore react-project"
G-Assist: "react-project context RESTORED!
Windows restored: 6
Browser tabs restored: 15
Environment variables: Restored
Originally kept at: 2025-07-18T10:30:00Z"
```

**Quick Save/Restore:**
```
You: "Quick save"
G-Assist: "Quick save SUCCESSFUL!
Saved as: auto-20250718-103045
Windows: 12
Browser tabs: 35
Use 'Quick switch' to restore instantly!"

You: "Quick switch"
G-Assist: "Recent contexts:
1. auto-20250718-103045
2. pytorch-research
3. react-project

Switching to: auto-20250718-103045"
```

**Managing Saved Contexts:**
```
You: "List contexts"
G-Assist: "Found 5 saved contexts:

pytorch-research:
  Saved: 2025-07-18T09:15:00Z
  Windows: 8, Tabs: 42

react-project:
  Saved: 2025-07-17T14:22:00Z

  - Check browser settings for tab restoration
  - Try closing and reopening the browser

- **Environment variables not working?**
  - Verify administrator privileges
  - Check if variables are system-wide or user-specific
  - Review environment snapshot files

### Logging

## Security and Privacy

### Data Protection
- All contexts are kept locally on your machine
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- Environment variables are encrypted when stored
- Sensitive information can be excluded from snapshots

### Permissions
The plugin requires:
- File system access for keeping contexts
- Process enumeration for application detection
- Window management permissions
- Network access for browser tab extraction (local only)

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- Incremental context keeping
- Background processing for large environments
- Selective application targeting
- Efficient browser tab batching

### Resource Usage
- Minimal memory footprint during idle state
- CPU usage spikes only during keep/restore operations
- Disk usage depends on context complexity
- Network usage limited to local browser debugging
