# Keeper Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refactoring from "context-keeper" to "Keeper" across the entire project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure
- Target: Rename `context-keeper/` to `Keeper/`
- Note: Due to directory being in use, created `complete_refactor.bat` to handle the final renaming

### 2. Code Files Updated

#### Plugin Files
- `plugin.py`:
  - Changed `DATA_DIR = Path.home() / ".context_keeper"` → `Path.home() / ".keeper"`
  - Changed `LOG_FILE = "context_keeper_plugin.log"` → `"keeper_plugin.log"`
  - Updated log messages from "Context Keeper" to "Keeper"

- `plugin_magic.py`:
  - Same changes as plugin.py for paths and logging

#### Test Files
- Renamed `test_context_keeper.py` → `test_keeper.py`
- Updated internal references via batch script

### 3. Build Configuration

#### build.bat
- Changed plugin name: `g-assist-plugin-contextkeeper` → `g-assist-plugin-keeper`
- Changed plugin directory: `context-keeper` → `keeper`
- Updated messages and launcher script name

#### Manifest Files
- `manifest.json`: Updated executable to `g-assist-plugin-keeper.exe`
- `manifest_magic.json`: Updated executable to `g-assist-plugin-keeper.exe`

#### Spec Files
- Renamed `context-keeper.spec` → `keeper.spec`
- Renamed `g-assist-plugin-contextkeeper.spec` → `g-assist-plugin-keeper.spec`

### 4. Documentation

#### README.md
- Title: "Context Keeper Plugin" → "Keeper Plugin"
- Updated all references to Context Keeper
- Changed executable name references
- Updated log file path
- Updated data directory path

#### DESIGN.md
- Changed header from "Context Keeper" to "Keeper"

#### MAGIC_API_DESIGN.md
- Updated title and references

### 5. User-Facing Changes

#### Data Storage
- Old: `%USERPROFILE%\.context_keeper\`
- New: `%USERPROFILE%\.keeper\`

#### Log Files
- Old: `%USERPROFILE%\contextkeeper.log`
- New: `%USERPROFILE%\keeper.log`

#### Executable
- Old: `g-assist-plugin-contextkeeper.exe`
- New: `g-assist-plugin-keeper.exe`

## Migration Steps

1. Run `complete_refactor.bat` to create the new Keeper directory
2. Test the build process in the new directory
3. Update G-Assist configuration to point to new plugin
4. Migrate user data from `.context_keeper` to `.keeper` if needed
5. Remove old context-keeper directory when confirmed working

## Backward Compatibility

The plugin maintains backward compatibility for:
- Command names (both old and new magic commands work)
- Parameter names (context_name and realm_name both accepted)
- Existing saved contexts can be migrated

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Build process works with new names
- [ ] Plugin loads in G-Assist
- [ ] Commands execute properly
- [ ] Data is saved to new location
- [ ] Logs are written to new location
- [ ] All documentation is accurate
